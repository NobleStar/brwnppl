        %h2 Respect the Brwnppl Community

        %p
          Please don't abuse the site. The beauty of Brwnppl and it’s features is that it puts the control in the hands of the community, and that involves trust. We trust you to be responsible and all our other users respect that trust, so please be one of them.
   
        %h2 We Review Content Flagged As Inappropriate
        
        %p
          Okay, this one is more about us than you. When a post gets flagged as inappropriate, we review it to determine whether it violates our Terms of Use—flagged posts are not automatically taken down by the system. If we remove your posts after reviewing it, you can assume that we removed it deliberately and you should take our warning notification seriously. Take a deep breath, read our Terms of Use, and try to see it from our perspective. If you find other posts on Brwnppl with the same violations, please flag them so we can review them as well!
   
        %h2 Don't Cross the Line
        
        %p
          Here are some common-sense rules that will help you steer clear of trouble:

        %p
          Brwnppl is not for pornography or sexually explicit content. If this describes your posts, even if it's about yourself, don't post it on Brwnppl. In addition, please be advised that we work closely with law enforcement and we report child exploitation.
            
        %p
          Don't post content showing things like animal abuse, drug abuse or bomb making.
          
        %p
          Graphic or gratuitous violence is not allowed. If your post shows someone getting hurt, attacked or humiliated, don't post it.

        %p
          Brwnppl is not a shock site. Don't post gory content of accidents, dead bodies or similar things.

        %p
          We encourage free speech and defend everyone's right to express unpopular points of view. But we do not permit hate speech (speech which attacks or demeans a group based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status and sexual orientation/gender identity).

        %p
          There is zero tolerance of predatory behaviour, stalking, threats, harassment, invading privacy or the revealing of other members' personal information. Anyone caught doing these things may be permanently banned from Brwnppl.
    
        %p
          Everyone hates spam. Do not create misleading descriptions, tags, titles or thumbnails in order to increase views. It's not OK to post large amounts of untargeted, unwanted or repetitive content, including comments and private messages.
        
        %p
          Please take these rules seriously and take them to heart. Don't try to look for loopholes or try to lawyer your way around them—just understand them and try to respect the spirit in which they were created. Violations of the Terms of Use may result in a warning notification or termination of your account. If your account is terminated you are prohibited from creating any new accounts.
